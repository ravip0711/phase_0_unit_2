		<h1>Week 5 Cultural Blog - Tech Problem</h1>
			<p>
				The one of the biggest problems in tech is the integration of technology especially old technologies. It's not a surprise that technology is constantly changing rapidly. Everything from the size of memory in laptops, the type of TVs, to software and hardware is constantly improving.

				Some major companies who have massive infrastructure already in place have numerous issues to deal with when it comes to technology. Current systems might be working, but the reality of it is that technology is ever-changing so there might be newer systems that bring more efficiency to the business. Problem is that companies do not want to be continuously spending money to integrate systems and technology. In terms of hardware for example, I was a manager at the retail store Guess and we have our own share of technology. We use a hand held scanner to scan shipments and inventory in. We always had problems with them not scanning and I was like there has to be a better scanner out there. Well just to give you an idea, Guess has nearly 1200+ stores worldwide, so the cost of replacing them would add an enormous cost to the balance sheets. That's apart from the cost of integrating it to the current system's softwares and reports system. On the software side, Guess has much to grow from its current systems. We offer a loyalty card that offers awards (like store credit) to repeat customers depanding on how much they spend at the store, but there is no way to track when awards will expire (they expire after a certain period of time). Another shortcoming is the integration of cards, many customers have numerous cards on file that create just extra data that is unnecessary and Guess associates have no control over merge features. These in my mind are important features that need to be implements but have yet to be and I have been with the company for over 2 years!

				Potential solutions for this would be to buy and create adaptable software and hardware. Just like how your smart phone may have a slot to add more memory in to it, the technology that companies decide to use should also have flexibility. This way when it comes time to implement new systems or hardware it will be cost effective, easy to merge, and efficient. Tech solutions should be built on the basis of elasticity so that when the need to upgrade arises, it would be far less complicated. If Guess used a flexible system, they would have been able to configure the ability to connect their loyalty card systems to the POS systems. If they used Ruby, they would just need to create a new class called LoyaltyAwards and use a method to copy awards expiration dates!
