		<h1>Week 6 Cultural Blog Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<p>
				Identify times when you felt it. How did it affect your achievement? What questions did you ask yourself? Did you feel it physically? If you don't think you've ever felt it, can you imagine some groups that might? What could you do to help others in that situation?

				In your post, describe your experiences with stereotype threat and how it affected you. Then identify what you plan to do when you feel stereotype threat or suspect someone else is feeling it. How will you create meaningful feedback or ask for feedback? How will you work to change the environment you're in to make it more welcoming? How will you address it in public?

				A time when I felt stereotype threat would be from my own community, the sense that Asians are suppose to be smarter in math and science than other races. There are many statistics that show Asians are employed in more science, medical, and math fields, but that does not mean that every Asian wants to be in those fields and that they are any better. I also feel that from Asian communities where Asian parents have a obsessive tendency for brainwashing their kids to think that being in the medical field is the best thing you can do in life and no other form of occupation will be as good enough.

				It affects me because your in a battle between doing what makes you happy vs what your parents want you to do. Even if you decide to do what makes you happy, you better hope you succeed in it fast otherwise you'll have to deal with the taunts of "see you would be making X amount of dollars by now if you were a doctor". In a way it makes you shoot for success because you have no other choice, but it also rushes you to figure what you should do. As with everything, not everyone succeed instantly, so the same thing happened with me. I've graduated from college and have been out for 3 years and have had my conversations about what are you doing with your life, how much money do you make, and etc. I began to introspect and kind of hate my situation. I was being punished for doing what I wanted to. I felt at times that maybe I wasn't good enough to succeed in what I wanted to do because I didn't follow the path of being a doctor.

				I feel like there is a lot of stereotyping that takes place that leads to stereotyping threat. I do also believe that no matter how hard we try to equal our minds and thoughts about races, it will not happen. What I mean is that instead of focusing on how stereotyping is bad, we should be more focused on accepting all the races. Educating ourselves and others about difference races. Growing up I never studied any curriculum that deals with race (besides in history class about the civil war and slavery) until college where I had a class on the culture of Islam and that was because I chose that elective. Knowing children are growing up in a diverse world and country, shouldn't we teach and make aware of races at an earlier time in life? I do believe bringing awareness will show that in the end we are all the same. African Americans aren't the only race to feel racism (I say this because I feel like whenever people talk about racism the first thing that comes to mind are African Americans), Hindus, Muslims, Hispanics, and Jewish people all feel racism. Everyone is subject to racism in various ways, but if it was taught that we are all nearly connected in someway or another, it would be a common ground resulting in less focus on the distinguishing of races. People would be less quick to point to race.

				I feel like if I didn't have this stereotype threat, I would have been able to reach greater lengths in my life. I would have focused more of my energy on doing what I want to instead of thinking how I can make my family, my community happy and live up to both of there expectations. I feel like in the end, I convinced myself that this is just negativity that I don't have to think about. I told my self I need to stop being negative and stop thinking about what other people think and say in the community. Ignore the noise and focus on my own progress. Its very simple but my best advice would be to "just follow your heart". Do what makes you happy because in the end its only about how you feel.

				If I see any stereotype threat happen, I would first address it by distinguishing facts from fiction. I will make sure that the person knows what he/she is saying is not true and that it causes the opposite of progression. It hinders anyones ability to perform and grow. I feel like I would educate them about how race has nothing to do with progression, it's because of people who say and perceive certain races to not be able to progress that leads those races to believe that they can't progress. This ultimately hinders growth and progression regardless of which race it is, even their own. I would change the environment I'm in by educating people that diversity is the key to helping everyone around us succeed and grow equally. Ultimately its not about how much more fish you can catch for yourself to survive, its about how many people you can teach to catch fish and survive.
