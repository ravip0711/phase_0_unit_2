		<h1>Week 6 Technical Blog Variable Scope</h1>
			<p>
				There are 4 different variable types:
				</p>
				<p>
				Local Variables: These variables begin with a lowercase letter or an underscore. These variables are only defined in the method. You use them when you only need them once in an method.
				</p>
				<p>
				Instance Variables: These variables begin with "@"". So the variable "name" would be @name. Instance variables are defined throughout all the methods within the class. They can change values throuhgout the class but will refer to the same element. Let's say I used @name to define an array of names for example @name = ["Ravi", "Tom", "Jerry"]. Then if I used the pop method such as @name.pop, it will remove the last element("Jerry") from the @name array. Later down in the class, if I used @name again, it will refer to the @name array ["Ravi", "Tom"] because we modified it.
				</p>
				<p>
				Class Variables: These variables start with "@@". So the variable "name" would be @@name. Class variables are defined throughout the class as it is a characteristic of the class. They are static and do not change throughout the class unless you explicitly change it. Then the variable assignment will change throughout the class. For example if my class variable is @@name = ["Ravi"], it will always point to ["Ravi"].
				</p>
				<p>
				Global Variables: These variables begin with "$". So the variable "name" would be translated to $name. These variables are available across classes within a program. They do not change throughout the program and therefore are not recommended to use unless absolutely necessary.
