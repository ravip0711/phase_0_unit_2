		<h1>Week 4 Technical Blog Ruby vs JavaScript</h1>
			<p>
				I felt as though using Ruby and JavaScript that Ruby made more sense to me. It might have been because I had worked with Ruby more, but JavaScript was a little all over the place for me. Being a beginner with the coding languages, I found Ruby to be easier to understand and comprehend.
				</br>
				</br>
				During my research I did find this and I think it sums up the differences between the two languages. Ruby in general was created by emphasizing productivity and attractiveness over conceptually small, well-understood code. JavaScript is more focused on creating smaller pieces of code into larger, well-understood programs. With this, each language has its own strenghts and weaknesses.
				</br>
				</br>
				Ruby and JavaScript are very similar, but majority of the time the syntax is a little different. Some examples of the basic differences that I understand are as follows:
				</br>
				</br>
				1. Ruby and JavaScript numbers are different. In JavaScript, all numbers are floating. They all have a decimal point whereas Ruby, you don't have decimal points, unless you ask for it. For example if you calculated 6/4 in Ruby, you would get 1. If you calculated 6/4 in JavaScript, you would get 1.5. This shows that in Ruby, you have to be careful when your using any of the math classes where you need exact answers.
				</br>
				</br>
				2. Javascript uses console.log and prompt() in its syntax to print text and recieve input. In Ruby, we use "puts" and "gets" to print text and recieve input. Pretty easy difference, as they both are used in different ways.
				</br>
				</br>
				3. JavaScript requires using var before a variable name to claim it as a variable. An example would be if I want to create a variable called "name" in Javascript, I would assign it as var name = "Ravi". In Ruby, you use the equal sign (=) to assign a variable. An example would be name = "Ravi".
				</br>
				</br>
				While all these are just the very few of the basic differences, I will definitly be learning more as I continue to practice. Learning is a journey so I encourage you to tread with me!
