				I don't really have too many conflicts because I stay away from anything that could be of conflict. In fact, I'm usually the person who is trying to solve the conflict between people.

				Anywho, there was this one time where I had a friend "M"(a man) dating a friend "F"(a women). They had been dating for couple years now and both of their families have been considering marriage for them. Note that, neither of the friend's parents know they are dating. As time is ticking, the pressure of marriage is upon their relationship. The friend "M" ends up breaking with friend "F" for reasons tied to not being able to tell his parents about his girlfriend. In our culture generally speaking, dating is done in secrecy because dating isn't the norm (well it just really depends on if you have traditional parents or modern parents). Since they were broken up, I decided to have a talk with friend "F" and told her that it is a good thing that they broke up, because knowing the families of both sides, it wouldn't work out smoothly. They have been brought up differently and the family lifestyles are very different. It would be better for them for the future to make sure they just ended instead of getting more attached later on. Voicing my opinons about their relationship, caring in general more for the girl in the relationship caused much drama. The friend "F" went and told friend "M" about what I had said and then friend "M" was really angry at me. I tried to speak my side of the story explaining to him why I said the things I did because I was only thinking about the best for both of them. The chats continued back and forth with exchanges of reasoning and anger. Being stubborn I didn't back off from proving my point, but that only lead arguments in a circle. If I had to go back and change my actions, I probably would have just kept my mouth shut. It kind of put me in a tight spot because you have two choices, 1. speak up and tell them the truth about their future together, or 2. shut up and let them worry about it amongst themselves even if it causes them (mainly the girl) pain. I was trying to be like an older brother to her protecting her, but it ended up backfiring on me when she went and told friend "M". I learned that sometimes in relationships, you should just let the two involved work out their mess, even if you are close to both. Then a part of me says, at least you did your part by being a good friend and making her aware of the real situation. They ended up getting together, but broke up again. I stopped caring since the incident because whats the point of caring for someone who doesn't value a friend who is watching out for them.
